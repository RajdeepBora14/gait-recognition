# gait-recognition

With an emphasis on gait detection in particular, the significance
of biometrics in safe access and privacy preservation is
expanding. The requirement to recognize unique gait patterns
in order to improve the precision and efficacy of human identification
models is the research challenge that is being tackled.
Through the use of a comprehensive approach that incorporates
advanced techniques for key point extraction from gait signatures,
human-oriented transformation (HOT) during data preprocessing,
and the integration of supplementary features within
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the study
aims to improve gait recognition models. The CASIA-B Dataset
is used in the process, and data taken with a 90Â°camera angle
is analyzed. The results show an impressive classification score
of 86.6%, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The implications of the study include the refinement and optimization
of gait recognition models, with potential applications
in surveillance, person identification, and other areas.


The dataset for this project was the CASIA-B dataset, available publicly. Following is the link to the dataset's webpage: http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/Gait%20Databases.asp
